moves2gcal
==========

A Django web app to transport Moves app places to Google Calendar

The idea is to let the user authenticate with Moves and Google OAuth endpoints, let moves2gcal pull
places from Moves and push them as events on Google Calendar.

This app will let users chose which calendar to send places, select secondary calendars for specific places
and also select some places to be ignored.
